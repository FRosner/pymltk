*pymltk* is a Python package helping data scientists with
their daily work of (pre)processing data and building predictive
or other machine learning models. It *offers various Python
functions which implement common operations done by data
scientists during their daily work*.

All functions of this package ...

* ... do one thing and (try to) do it well.
* ... operate on pandas as well as dask dataframes.
* ... are fully tested and documented.
* ... offer a clean and consistent UI.

This package was inspired by `mlr <https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr>`_,
a R package which offers similar functionality with respect to data
(pre)processing (but in addition offers *a lot* more).
